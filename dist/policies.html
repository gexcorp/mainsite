        <p class="text-info">Effective date: July 30, 2018</p>
        <div>
          <p>GEX Corporation ("us", "we", or "our") uses cookies on the https://www.gexcorp.com website (the "Service"). By using the Service, you consent to the use of cookies. Our Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use cookies, how
            third-parties we may partner with may use cookies on the Service, your choices regarding cookies and further information about cookies.</p>

          <h5>What are cookies</h5>

          <p>Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Service or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Service more useful to you.</p>

          <p>Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.</p>

          <p>A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more
            useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience</p>

          <h5>How GEX Corporation uses cookies</h5>

          <p>When you use and access the Service, we may place a number of cookies files in your web browser. We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>To enable certain functions of the Service</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To provide analytics</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>We use both session and persistent cookies on the Service and we use different types of cookies to run the Service:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Essential cookies. We may use cookies to remember information that changes the way the Service behaves or looks, such as a user's language preference on the Service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Analytics cookies. We use analytics cookies to track information how the Service is used so that we can make improvements. We may also use analytics cookies to test new advertisements, pages, features or new functionality of the Service to see how
                our users react to them.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Third-party cookies</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>We use
              <strong>Google Analytics</strong>
              to report usage statistics of the user interaction with our website, such as location, usage time, and device type.
            </li>
            <li>We use
              <strong>Zendesk</strong>
              for managing our Customer Support portal of the GEX website.
              <ul>

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>What are your choices regarding cookies</h5>

          <p>If you'd like to delete cookies or instruct your web browser to delete or refuse cookies, please visit the help pages of your web browser. You can opt-out of having making your site activity available to Google Analytics by installing the Google
            Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (gtag.js, ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) that is running on websites from sharing information with Google Analytics about visit activity. To get this add-on, see
            the Google support page
